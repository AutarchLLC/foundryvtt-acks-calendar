# Adding Notes

![](media://add-notes.png)

If a user is allows to add a note, the add note button will appear in the action button section of the main calendar.

Users who can add a note are:

- Users in the GM role can always add a note.
- Users in any of the other roles that the GM has configured to be allowed to add notes. See {@page ../../global-configuration/permissions.md the permissions page} for more details.

Clicking on the Add Note button will create a new note for that day and open up the [note details in edit view](#editing-notes). Read that section for details on all the fields and what they do!

# Editing Notes

Users are allowed to edit any notes that they have added and GM's are allowed to edit any note they can view.

If you are able to edit a note you will see some additional buttons when you are viewing the notes details.

## Pages

Each calendar note can have different pages of information, if that makes sense for the note. This leverages the built-in FoundryVTT journal pages that were added in v10. By default, each note will have a single text page.

The collapsible sidebar is where new pages can be added (green add button) or existing pages removed (red trashcan button). The sidebar can also search page names to make it easier to find specific pages if there are many attached to the note.

Every page has a name and type associated with it, then depending on the type selected there will be additional fields to fill out for that page.

### Page Name

Each page can have a name given to it to let players know what that page contains. This is also what is used when search pages in the page collapsible sidebar.

### Page Type

There are 4 different types of pages

#### Text
